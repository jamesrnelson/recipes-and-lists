        how to make this recipe.                    For the donuts: Add the yeast,
        granulated sugar, milk, flour, salt, eggs, egg yolks and shortening to a mixing
        bowl (in the order listed). Mix on low speed with a dough hook attachment
        until the dough is very smooth and elastic and makes a slapping sound against
        the sides of the bowl, 25 to 30 minutes. Scrape the dough into a greased container,
        cover and refrigerate overnight.                          Two hours before
        you want to roll the dough, remove it from the refrigerator to temper. Dump
        the dough onto a floured work surface and roll to 1/2-inch thick. Cut the
        donuts using a donut cutter and place on a tray with parchment paper that''s
        been greased and floured. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof for 1 hour.                          Turn
        on your deep fryer to 325 degrees F. When they are ready to fry, the donuts
        will be very light and airy feeling; they should barely hold their shape when
        handled. Fry for 2 minutes per side. Drain on a wire rack or paper towels.                          For
        the butter crunch: First, make the toffee. Heat the butter, granulated sugar
        and salt in a nonreactive pan on medium-high heat, stirring constantly with
        a wooden spoon. Cook until deep golden or camel colored. Pour onto a silicone
        baking mat or sprayed parchment paper on a tray and let cool completely. It
        will be very hard and shatter if you tap it. Then, grind the toffee in a food
        processor with the toasted pecans. It should be uniformly finely ground.                          For
        the glaze: Whisk the milk and confectioners'' sugar together until perfectly
        smooth. Strain to remove any lumps.                          To assemble:
        Dunk the cooled donuts in the glaze. Let it drain for 1 minute. Roll the donut
        in the butter crunch, making sure to completely cover all sides.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Watch

        cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate.
